        "Anyone noticing anything?" Professor Thotep asked.<br><br>The class was silent.<br><br>"I'll replay the <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnfudjQwjS8&feature=youtu.be&t=1105" target="_blank">video</a> once
        more." Once it was finished, he reiterated: "Who noticed something unusual?"<br><br>There were a few chuckles
        from the audience. After playing it four more times, Professor Thotep was confident that most of the students
        knew what was going on. He asked one of the students in the front row what was odd about the video.<br><br>"The
        character in the second shot is not only a different person, he's wearing different clothes!"<br><br>"That's
        exactly correct, and the time that it took many of you to notice this demonstrates humans' selective attention.
        This particular kind of selective attention is referred to as change blind--"<br><br>Before Thotep could finish
        his sentence, officers wearing black masks and body armor with jet-packs flew through the windows on the East
        side of the room, and several armed with heavy shields and taser clubs burst through the front and back doors
        on the West side of the room.<br><br>The slender, cloaked figure at the front of the room released a cacophony
        which he had spent ten thousand years perfecting to sound like hundreds of men, women, and children being
        slowly crushed and burned to death. Intimidation tactics weren't going to work on the agency's elite officers,
        they knew exactly what the target of the mission was and they were prepared to handle it. However, there was
        one possibility that they hadn't considered.<br><br>The students had long anticipated that this would happen
        one day. The student body of the entire school had developed a tradition: if you find out that you have Nyarla
        Thotep as an instructor, you always bring something to class that could be used as a weapon.<br><br>The
        officers new that they had a formidable enemy before them, and were intensely focused on how to take Thotep
        down. So focused, in fact, that they didn't take note of the many students lifting baseball bats and tennis
        rackets. They didn't realize that it was strange for many college students to carry loose wires and convoluted
        apparati formed of hot-glue and plastic-wear in their backpacks, nor did they appear to care that they had
        already moved past a great number of students and that several of them had just thrown a rope across the main
        aisle.<br><br>The team of six officers who rushed in from the back door tripped without knowing why.
        Simultaneously, two students who had procured makeshift slingshots and fired at the heads of the officers with
        jet-packs, knocking them out. Seeing two of their allies fall convinced the remaining ten airborne officers
        that the target's psychic powers were stronger than the enchantments on their linen masks, so they began to
        charge the transforming beast. The third set of officers, who had gotten the closest to the target, realized
        what was going on, but it was too late because they had already passed enough students who were willing to
        knock them in the head with their equipment.<br><br>Meanwhile in the main aisle, A few of the wire-wielding
        students had predicted the use of taser-clubs and had decided to bring highly insulative gloves. They quickly
        decided to wrap the wire around each of the downed officers' limbs and clubs. The guards were only down for a
        few seconds though, and the students only had time to entangle four of the officers before their recovery
        pulled wire out of the students' hands. One of the officers realizes that the students had tripped them and,
        infuriated, began to swing at the one closest to him; right before the blow connected, the officer made the
        mistake of also turning on the taser. All four the tangled guards fell back onto the floor, spasming as their
        clubs short-circuited and current ran through their bodies. The other two officers didn't last long as they
        were already surrounded by heavy-metal-object-wielding students. As the remainder collapsed, the students
        nabbed their shields and, along with the students who had defended the front door, ran to surround Professor
        Thotep.<br><br>The most experienced officer was at the front of the airborne officers, and he was ready to
        subdue the target regardless of how many shield-wielding children he had to knock down. He wasn't surprised
        when a student wielding a multi-pronged plastic fork spear jumped off of a desk right in front of him because
        he didn't even have time to register it. The spear went right through his face, but the momentum he had gained
        caused his corpse to keep flying, breaking the student's weapon.<br><br>Nine flying officers were still
        swarming about and dodging projectiles. They were able to fire a few shots at the giant atrocity that stood
        where the instructor once had, but the monster didn't seem to care. The slingshotters ran out of ammo, but the
        wire-wielders had just had a marvelous idea. They carefully wrapped their wire around the triggers of the
        remaining taser clubs and threw them at the flying officers. The first one missed, but the second one connected
        with one of the jet-pack fuel tanks. The explosion that followed was beyond what anyone was expecting. The
        blast knocked everyone to the floor and sent the remaining airborne officers flying towards the walls, knocking
        them out.<br><br>As the students recovered, ears still ringing, their instructor released a sound reminiscent
        of a mixture of nails and flesh being forced through a chalkboard tube by small, successive explosions.<br><br>"Excuse
        me, I was merely clearing my throat," explained the pile of eyes, claws, tentacles, and teeth. "Had I
        anticipated that superb example of fatal selective attention that we just witnessed, I wouldn't have bothered
        showing the video that many times," it said in a voice that threatened the sanity of it's listeners. The horror
        began shrinking and retracting its many protuberances, eventually re-obtaining the form of a tall, emaciated,
        pale humanoid with an elongated skull and white eyes. "Class dismissed."
