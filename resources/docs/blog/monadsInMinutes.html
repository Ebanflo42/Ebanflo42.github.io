                I'd like to preface this article by explaining why I think many people find monads confusing. In the
                context of programming, a monad is not fundamentally unlike an interface; it's just that the functions
                that a monad must implement (and perhaps the properties that the functions must satisfy) seem alien at
                first. Many examples of a certain monad in action can be given, but they all seem unrelated, which can
                be confusing. It's ultimately the existence of these <i>many</i> examples that makes monads such a
                critical idea - it turns out that many useful notions of computation (<a target="_blank" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/21173011.pdf">to
                        use Moggi's terminology</a>) can be encoded in a pure functional language as monads.
                <br><br>
                In other words: I think you think monads are confusing because you are looking for a motivation for the
                definition, but the usefulness of the definition comes <i>after</i> we start applying it.
                <br><br>
                A pure functional program is simply a composition of functions. That is, a sequence of functions whose
                domains and codomains match up so that input can be passed through consecutive functions. A pure
                imperative program is a sequence of commands for the retrieval and manipulation of data. It's difficult
                to see how commands like this could be composed in the way pure functions can be. A monad is a special
                kind of operator on types that allows us to compose imperative actions in the same way that we do
                functions. This is why monads are important - they allow us to do things like achieve side effects,
                monitor state, and throw exceptions in a pure functional language.
                <br><br>
                It's best to know a little bit about Haskell syntax before reading this article. If you know any other
                functional language you can probably catch on pretty easily. The only Haskell features that pop up are
                lambdas, pattern matching, and type signatures. If you're totally new to Haskell, I would recommend
                checking out <a target="_blank" href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> or

                Monads answer the question of how to get imperative behavior in a pure functional language. What
                distinguishes functional behavior from imperative behavior? In a pure functional language the only
                thing you can actually do is compose and
                apply functions, where functions are always look-up tables that don't change and do nothing but return
                a value whenever they are passed an argument of the correct type. Just like in all forms of
                programming, it is common to solve a problem by
                composing many functions, each of which solves part of the problem and is more understandable to the
                programmer. Most compilers for imperative languages aren't optimized for this sort of behavior in its
                purest form, which always uses recursion
                instead of loops. Imperative programs are sometimes written as a sequence of commands; each one without
                any input or output. A crude example:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        void main() {<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />getInput();<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />processInput();<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />printOutput();<br>
                        }
                </code>
                <br><br> You could of course make <code>processInput()</code> a pure function, bind the input to a
                variable, pass that variable to your new pure function, and then print out the result. However, the act
                of getting input and printing output are
                still side effects. They can't be composed like ordinary functions. This doesn't mean there isn't any
                way to compose them at all. Let's take a look at the defintion of a monad in Haskell:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        class Monad m where<br>
                        return :: a -> m a<br>
                        (>>=)<span style="margin:1.1em" />:: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b<br>
                        (>>)<span style="margin:1.6em" />:: m a -> m b -> m b
                </code>
                <br><br>
                What the first line of this declaration is saying is that there exists a class called <code>Monad</code>
                whose instances, <code>m</code>, act as wrappers for an arbitrary type <code>a</code>. Below the
                declaration is a number of functions
                which this wrapper must implement. So it's kind of like an interface in object oriented programming.
                <br><br>
                The first function that our monad, <code>m</code>, must implement is called <code>return</code>, not at
                all to be confused with the return statement in imperative programming. The type signature for this
                function says that it goes from the arbitrary type <code>a</code> into the <i>monadic value</i> of that
                type, <code>m a</code>, i.e. the monad wrapping that type. This is like the generic constructor that
                classes/structs/objects have in object-oriented programming. That is to say, every monad must have at
                least one type constructor. We'll get into what exactly is special about return when I talk about the
                constraints that these functions must satisfy.
                <br><br>
                The next weird looking function is called the bind operator. Looking at it's type signature, we see
                that it takes in <code>m a</code>, followed by a function from <code>a</code> to <code>m b</code>, and
                then outputs something in <code>m b</code>. What could that be useful for? Well, let's return to the
                example of the imperative program with side effects, there is a monad called <code>IO</code>, which
                deals with input/output actions, there is a value in <code>IO String</code> called <code>getLine</code>,
                which secretly holds the value of the string that a user enters at the console. There is also a
                function <code>putStrLn</code> with type <code>String -> IO ()</code> that simply takes a string as
                input and outputs a monad action that prints it to the console. Recall that () is the type of tuples
                that wrap no values - i.e. the type with only one element. Then I could write a Haskell program that
                looks like this:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        main = getLine >>= putStrLn . processInput
                </code>
                <br><br> In this case, <code>processInput</code> must be a function that takes any string to a string.
                The "." represents the composition of <code>processInput</code> and <code>putStrLn</code>. So this
                program executes the action of getting the input from the console, the bind operator then unwraps it
                and sends it to a function that processes it and then prints the output to the console. I like to think
                of the <code> >>=</code> symbol as squeezing the value out of the monadic value and then injecting it
                into the function on the right. Regardless of metaphor, what we've done is compose imperative actions
                even though they don't output values! This may look very alien and non-imperative, but Haskell has
                something called "do notation" that can be used to make particularly long sequences of monad actions
                more readable.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <code>>></code> gives us a way to compose arbitrarily many monad actions of different types
                (the monad must remain the same but the type that it wraps can be different for each of the actions
                being composed), without having to explicitly unwrap any data. This means that <code>>></code> can
                literally be read as "and then do" in code. For example:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        main = (getLine >>= putStrLn . processInput) >> main
                </code>
                <br><br>
                Is the exact same program that we constructed before except that it repeats itself every time after
                printing. I like to think of the <code>>></code> symbol as an arrow telling the program where to go
                next.
                </p>

                <u><big><b>The Monad Laws</big></b></u>
                <br><br>
                You can't just make any old parametrized type that implements functions with the above type signatures
                and call it a monad. You could in Haskell, GHC doesn't check that an instance of <code>Monad</code>
                obeys these rules; that would be extrmely difficult, so its up to the programmer. If you wrote an
                instance of <code>monad</code> that didn't satisfy the properties described below then it wouldn't be a
                monad by the mathematical definition and it probably wouldn't be as useful as an actual monad. For a
                monad to be a monad it's functions have to satisfy the following "monad laws:"
                <br><br> Left Identity: <code>return a >>= f = f a</code><br> Right Identity: <code>m >>= return = m</code><br>
                Associativity: <code>(m >>= f) >>= g = m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)</code>
                <br><br> These requirements are a lot simpler than they appear. The first one says that if we wrap up a
                value using <code>return</code>, then we want <code>>>=</code> to be able to unwrap that same value and
                feed it to the next function. The second
                condition says something similar it just looks more strange because there aren't any non-monadic values
                in the definition. It says that if <code>>>=</code> unwraps a value and feeds it to <code>return</code>,
                then we'll get the same wrapped
                value back. Hopefully it makes sense that both of these things would be something desirable for a
                default type constructor, which is basically what <code>return</code> is.
                <br><br>
                As for the associativity condition, since function composition is a associative, i.e. <code>(f . g) . h
                        = f . (g . h)</code>, we desire the same thing to be true when we compose imperative actions.
                The left side of the equation represents feeding the value inside <code>m</code> into <code>f</code> <i>and
                        then</i> feeding the result into <code>g</code>; the right side of the equation represents
                first constructing a function (the lambda) that takes <code>x</code> then feeds it into <code>f</code>
                then into <code>g</code> and then feeding the value inside <code>m</code> into this lambda. The
                associativity condition ensures that these two ways of feeding the value inside <code>m</code> through
                the functions are the same.
                </p><p class="textContent" id="Examples">
                <u><big><b>Examples</big></b></u>
                <br><br> The example that I've already brought up is the <code>IO</code> monad. IO stands for
                Input/Output, so it's role is pretty self-exaplantory - monad actions get compiled to input/output
                actions.
                <br><br> Another common example of a monad that isn't often referred to as a monad is <code>[a]</code>,
                the type of lists with elements from <code>a</code>. Here's what the monad functions look like for
                lists:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        return x = [x]<br>
                        xs >>= f = concat (map f xs)<br>
                        xs >> ys = ys
                </code>
                <br><br>
                <code>return</code> simply takes a value and makes a list that contains only that value. The bind
                operator maps the function onto the list that is passed to it, which makes a list of lists, and then
                <code>concat</code> flattens that list. The
                then operator simply returns the second list. This may seem useless, but its not quite useless. In
                functional programming the great thing about the type of lists is that it is an instance of <code>Functor</code>.
                This is the typeclass which gives us the <code>map</code> function for lists, which takes a list and a
                function and applies the function to every element of the list. It turns out that the monad structure
                of the list type isn't completely essential for applications, but <code>map</code> can be written in
                terms of <code>>>=</code> and <code>return</code> (how?).
                <br><br>
                <code>Maybe a</code> is a type that is probably less familiar to object-oriented programmers but it's
                not at all difficult to understand:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
                </code>
                <br><br> This means that <code>Maybe a</code>, for some type <code>a</code>, is either a box called
                <code>Just</code> with a value from <code>a</code> inside it or it's a box called <code>Nothing</code>
                with nothing inside it. This wrapper for types is excellent for representing computations that could
                fail. Here's how it works as a monad:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        return x <span style="margin:3em" />= Just x<br>
                        Nothing >>= f = Nothing<br>
                        Just x >>= f <span style="margin:0.5em" />= f x<br>
                        Nothing >> _ <span style="margin:0.5em" />= Nothing<br>
                        Just _ >> m <span style="margin:1em" />= m
                </code>
                <br><br> In practice, the use of this type's monad functionality is extremely useful. Imagine this, you
                have an important function, <code>foo :: String -> Maybe String</code>, and it's broken into steps:
                <br><br>
                <code>foo = stepThree . stepTwo . stepOne</code>.
                <br><br> But the failure that causes the output to be <code>Nothing</code> could happen at any step,
                i.e.:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        stepOne <span style="margin:1.2em" />:: String -> Maybe MyType<br>
                        stepTwo <span style="margin:1.2em" />:: MyType -> Maybe [Int]<br>
                        stepThree :: [Int] <span style="margin:0.6em" />-> Maybe String
                </code>
                <br><br> So since the domains and ranges don't match up, <code>foo = stepThree . stepTwo . stepOne</code>
                would actually cause a type error. What we can do, however, is say
                <br><br><code>foo = \x -> stepOne x >>= stepTwo >>= stepThree</code><br><br> And huzzah! We have a way
                of composing computations that could fail without having to manually unwrap the value for each step!
                <br><br> I want to conclude this section by mentioning that if the metaphor of >>= unwrapping the value
                in its first argument and injecting that value into the function that is its second argument, that's
                okay. The <a target="_blank" href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Control-Monad.html"><code>Control.Monad</code></a>
                library provides a few variations of the bind operator:
                <br><br><code>
                        (=<<) :: (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
                                <br>
                                (>=>) (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> a -> m c

                Everything that I've covered so far should allow you to effectively use monads as a programmer. But
                there is more to the definition of a monad. I'm assuming you're familiar with basic categry theoretic
                terminology from this point on.
                If you aren't, I'd recommend Bartosz Milewski's online book <a target="_blank" href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface">Category
                        Theory for Programmers</a>, which has lots of C++ examples, or his

                        series</a>, which makes more use of Haskell.
                <br><br>
                The first thing we should discuss is monoids. Monoids are usually formulated in terms of sets.
                Specifically, a monoid is a set $S$ with an operation $(\cdot) : S \times S \rightarrow S$ and $1\in S$
                such that $$\forall s\in S \quad 1\cdot
                s = s \cdot 1 = s$$ $$\forall a,b,c\in S \quad (a\cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot (b\cdot c)$$ One familiar
                example of a monoid is the type of lists of any data structure. That is, the identity, $1$, is the
                empty list and the binary operation is concatenation.
                Another example of interest is the set of all functions from a given set to itself; the identity is the
                identity function and the operation is composition of functions.
                <br><br>
                In category theory however, we don't like talking about sets. We want to construct a monoid based on
                the morphisms of some category. The first thing we have to do is define a monoidal category. A monoidal
                category $\mathbb{C}$ is one
                with a bifunctor, called the tensor product, $\otimes : \mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C} \rightarrow
                \mathbb{C}$ and an "identity object," $I$, such that $\forall A,\, B, \, C\in Ob(\mathbb{C})$ there is
                an isomorphism $\alpha_{A,B,C} : (A \otimes
                B)\otimes C \rightarrow A\otimes (B\otimes C)$ (associativity) as well as isomorphisms $\lambda_A :
                I\otimes A \rightarrow A$ (left identity), and $\, \rho_A : A\otimes I \rightarrow A$ (right identity).
                <br><br>
                We can generalize the idea of a monoid categorically by defining a <i>monoid in a monoidal category</i>.
                A monoid in the monoidal category $\mathbb{C}$ is an object $M$ in $\mathbb{C}$ with a morphism $\mu:
                M\otimes M \rightarrow M$ and
                another morphism $\eta: I \rightarrow M$. These morphisms must satisfy the following "coherence
                conditions:" $$\mu \circ (id_M\otimes \mu) \circ \alpha_{M, M, M} = \mu \circ (\mu \otimes id_M)$$
                $$\mu \circ (id_M \otimes \eta) = \lambda_M$$ $$\mu
                \circ (\eta \otimes id_M) = \rho_M$$ Recall that $\alpha$ is an isomorphism that "reassociates" the
                tensor product, so the first condition is analogous to associativity. The second and third conditions
                are left identity and right identity, respectively.
                The meaning of these conditions is made much more clear with diagrams, something I do not have but that
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid_(category_theory)">Wikipedia does</a>. If one assumes
                that the underlying category is the category
                of sets, with $\otimes$ being the Cartesian product and $I$ being a set with one element, then the
                original algebraic defintion of a monoid is recovered.
                <br><br>
                But again, sets are boring. What's another example of a monoidal category? The category of endofunctors
                on some category $\mathbb{C}$. $\otimes$ is identified as the composition of endofunctors (which, like
                the composition of all morphisms,
                is associative) and the identity object is $id_{\mathbb{C}}$ - the identity endofunctor. So what would
                a monoid in this category look like? Well, it would be an endofunctor $T$ with a natural tranformation
                $\mu:T\circ T \rightarrow T$ and another
                natural transformation $\eta : id_{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow T$ that satisfy the conditions for a monoid;
                that's what a monad is!
                <br><br>
                For a monad, the coherence conditions are as follows: $$\mu \circ T \eta = \mu \circ \eta T = id_T$$
                $$\mu \circ T \mu = \mu \circ \mu T$$ In this case, the left and right identity morphisms, $\lambda_T$
                and $\rho_T$, are the identity
                on $T$. $\, (T\eta)_x=T(\eta_x)$ and $(\eta T)_x = \eta_{T\, x}$. Likewise for $T\mu$ and $\mu T$.
                <br><br> But wait how could any of that possibly relate to all the programming? To see, let's make a
                Haskell type class:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        class MyMonad M where<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />fun :: (a -> b) -> (M a -> M b)<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />mu<span style="margin:1.2em" />:: M (M a) -> M a<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />eta :: a -> M a<br>
                </code>
                <br>
                <code>fun</code> is the endofunctor itself. The endofunctor is acting on the category of all Haskell
                types. A functor acts on both objects (types) and morphisms (functions). When the functor acts on a
                morphism $f$ it yields a morphism whose domain is the functor acting on the domain of $f$, likewise for
                the codoamin. This explains the type signature of the first function in our class. The others shouldn't
                be too difficult to understand as they are equivalent to $\mu:M\circ M \rightarrow M$ and $\eta :
                id_{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow M$. The difference is that in the category-theoretic notation we consider
                the endofunctor as acting on the entire category but in Haskell notation we are considering it as
                acting on a particular object.
                <br><br> We also demand that these functions satisfy the above conditions for a monad. In Haskell,
                these can be written like so:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        eta . f = fun f . eta<br>
                        nu . fun (fun f) = fun f . nu
                </code>
                <br><br> Now that we have that set up, let's show that it's equivalent to the definition of monad in
                Haskell. Haskell monads are actually called Kleisli triples in Category theory, so let's call our next
                class that:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        class KleisliTriple T where<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />ret :: a -> T a<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />>>== :: T a -> (a -> T b) -> T b
                </code>
                <br><br> Notice that the <i>then</i> operator, <code> >></code> is not defined in a Kleisli triple.
                That's because it actually has the following default implementation:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        m1 >> m2 = m1 >>= (\_ -> m2)
                </code>
                <br><br> The <code>KleisliTriple</code> class must satisfy the "monad laws" discussed earlier in the
                article. Now all that's left to do is the following:
                <br><br>
                <code>
                        instance KleisliTriple t => MyMonad t where<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />fun f m = m >>== (ret . f)<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />eta = ret<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />mu m = m >>== id<br>
                        <br>
                        instance MyMonad t => KleisliTriple t where<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />ret = eta<br>
                        <span style="margin:2em" />m >>== f = mu (fun f m)
                </code>
                <br><br> One can verify that if the conditions for either instance are assumed, the conditions for the
                other follow. I won't show that here since I think its a useful exercise for the reader. Once that's
                been done, however, you've proven that
                Haskell monads are monoids on the category of endofunctors on the underlying category of Haskell types!
