        <big><b><u>About</u></b></big><br><br>
        I am a mathematician at heart with a passion for digital art, machine learning, and philosophy. One of my favorite novels of 2024 was "Parable of the Sower," by Octavia Butler, as well as its sequel "Parable of the Talents." I highly recommend her work to anyone.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am a Machine Learning and Signal Processing Engineer at NXP Semiconductors. My job involves improving the on-chip processing of ultra-wideband radar data (for smartphones and TVs, not missiles). I'm also finishing up a Master's degree in Mathematics at TU Graz. My thesis will focus on extending linear-programming-based lower bounds for the cardinalities of t-designs on projective spaces.
        <br><br>
        In my free time, I enjoy yoga, strength training, video games (especially Titanfall 2), as well as whacky programming side-projects (hence the rest of this blog).
